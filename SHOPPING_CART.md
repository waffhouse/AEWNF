# Shopping Cart and Order System Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of a basic shopping cart and order system for A&E Wholesale of North Florida. The system will allow customers to add products to a cart, place orders, and view order history. Staff/admin users will be able to view and manage orders.

## Database Structure

### 1. Cart System
- **carts** table:
  - `id` - Primary key
  - `user_id` - Foreign key to users table
  - `created_at`, `updated_at` - Timestamps

- **cart_items** table:
  - `id` - Primary key
  - `cart_id` - Foreign key to carts table
  - `inventory_id` - Foreign key to inventories table
  - `quantity` - Integer
  - `price` - Decimal (store current price at time of adding)
  - `created_at`, `updated_at` - Timestamps

### 2. Order System
- **orders** table:
  - `id` - Primary key
  - `user_id` - Foreign key to users table
  - `total` - Decimal (total order amount)
  - `status` - String (pending, completed, cancelled)
  - `notes` - Text (optional customer notes)
  - `created_at`, `updated_at` - Timestamps

- **order_items** table:
  - `id` - Primary key
  - `order_id` - Foreign key to orders table
  - `inventory_id` - Foreign key to inventories table
  - `quantity` - Integer
  - `price` - Decimal (price at time of order)
  - `product_name` - String (stored at time of order)
  - `product_sku` - String (stored at time of order)
  - `created_at`, `updated_at` - Timestamps

## Permissions Structure

We've implemented the following new permissions:

- `add to cart` - Allows adding products to cart
- `place orders` - Allows checking out and placing orders
- `view own orders` - Allows customers to view their order history
- `view all orders` - Allows staff to view all customer orders
- `manage orders` - Allows staff to update order status

All permissions are checked at multiple levels:
1. Route/middleware level
2. Controller/component method level
3. Blade template level using `@can` directives

  - Blade templates: `@can('view own orders')`
- Users without proper permissions see appropriate error messages or have UI elements hidden

## Note on NetSuite Integration
This implementation focuses on the front-end user experience and basic order tracking. The actual inventory management, invoicing, and fulfillment will be handled in NetSuite separately.

## Known Issues and Solutions

### 1. Cart Counter Update
**Issue**: ✅ RESOLVED
The cart counter in the navigation bar wasn't updating reliably when items were added or removed from the cart.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created a dedicated Livewire component (CartCounter) for the cart counter
- Enhanced the component to handle events properly
- Improved database queries to ensure fresh data for cart item counts
- Added location awareness to handle both desktop and mobile navigation independently
- Implemented fallback polling to ensure consistency
- Used Livewire events to communicate between cart components 
- Added Alpine.js integration for consistent UI updates across page navigations

### 2. Mobile Responsiveness
**Issue**: ✅ RESOLVED
Some screens weren't optimized for mobile viewing, particularly the order management dashboard, shopping cart, order history and order details pages.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Converted the order management table to a card-based layout
- Implemented responsive grids for better item display on small screens
- Created mobile-specific layouts for detailed order information
- Improved button sizing and spacing for touch interactions
- Added persistent cart icon in mobile header for immediate access
- Implemented proper spacing in mobile layouts for improved touchability
- Replaced cart table with card-based layout on small screens
- Made cart item information better organized for small screens
- Created sticky order summary with consistent positioning on scroll
- Converted order history to use card-based layouts on small screens
- Created modal-based order details view with responsive design
- Eliminated horizontal scrolling on order history page
- Made buttons stack vertically on mobile for better touch targets
- Added clear icons to buttons for better visual guidance
- Created consistent responsive patterns across all order-related screens

### 3. Order Management UX
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
Initial implementation lacked workflow efficiency and was difficult to access for staff users.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Order management is now integrated into the admin dashboard as a tab
- Uses the same design patterns as other admin tabs
- Implemented with a streamlined interface showing all orders
- Pending orders are always prioritized at the top for better workflow efficiency
- Provides searching by order ID, customer name, email or customer number
- Displays clear order status counts in a compact summary
- Offers a detailed view modal with responsive design for all screen sizes
- Added staff access to order management while preserving role-based permissions
- Made order management accessible to staff users without full admin privileges
- Uses infinite scrolling for better performance with large order sets

### 4. Cart Visibility and UX
**Issue**: ✅ RESOLVED
Mobile users needed to open the hamburger menu to access their cart, and had no way to quickly see their cart total.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added a persistent cart icon in the mobile header that's always visible
- Enhanced cart counter to display total price alongside item count
- Positioned the cart total elegantly next to count badges throughout the UI
- Made the cart icon immediately accessible without opening the full navigation menu
- Updated UI to prominently display cart status for better shopping experience

### 5. Order Details Workflow
**Issue**: ✅ RESOLVED
Previously, order details were displayed on a separate page, requiring navigation away from the order list. After checkout, users were redirected to a separate order details page.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Converted order details to use a modal-based interface throughout the application
- Order details are now displayed in a responsive modal overlay
- After checkout, order details are immediately displayed in a modal
- Order history page now shows order details in a modal
- Admin order management now uses the same modal pattern

- Eliminated unnecessary page redirects for a more fluid user experience
- Made all order details modals responsive for all screen sizes
